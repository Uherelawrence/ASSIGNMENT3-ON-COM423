 How does expert system resolve rule base conflict
             Answer
Expert system resolve rule base conflict through various ways which includes

1. Conflict Resolution Strategies:
Last Match: Applies the most recently matched rule when multiple rules are triggered simultaneously.
Most Specific: Prefers rules that match the most specific conditions or constraints.

Certainty Factor or Weighted Rules: Combines rules using certainty factors or weights to calculate a final decision based on the degree of confidence in each rule's conclusion.

Rule Ordering: Orders rules in a sequence that resolves potential conflicts based on predefined criteria.

2. Rule Execution Control:
Control Strategies: Implement control strategies to manage rule firing, such as allowing rules to fire only once, firing rules in a specified sequence, or applying constraints on rule execution.

3. Rule Priority or Precedence: Rules are assigned priorities based on their importance or specificity to the current problem. When conflicts arise, the system applies the rule with the highest priority or precedence.

4. Rule Salience: Rules may be assigned salience values that indicate their relative importance or relevance in different situations. The system resolves conflicts by giving precedence to rules with higher salience values.

5. User Intervention:

Manual Override: Allows users to intervene in the decision-making process to select or adjust rules based on their judgment or additional information not considered by the system.

These strategies ensure that expert systems can handle conflicting rules effectively, applying appropriate logic and reasoning to reach accurate conclusions or recommendations based on the knowledge and rules stored in thei
